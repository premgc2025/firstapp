                    <p>Lumbini's importance dates back to the 6th century BCE when Queen Maya Devi, the wife of King Suddhodana of the Shakya dynasty, gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in the Lumbini Garden. The historical accounts suggest that Queen Maya Devi, while traveling to her maternal home, stopped at Lumbini and, captivated by the beauty of the garden, decided to rest there. It was under a sal tree that she gave birth to Siddhartha, who would go on to attain enlightenment and become the Buddha.</p><br />

                    Emperor Ashoka of India, a devout follower of Buddhism, visited Lumbini in the 3rd century BCE. To commemorate his visit and the birthplace of Buddha, he erected the Ashoka Pillar, which still stands as a testament to Lumbini's historical significance. The pillar, inscribed with Brahmi script, provides evidence of Ashoka's pilgrimage and his dedication to preserving the memory of Buddha's birthplace.
